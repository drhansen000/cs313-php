        <h2>A Little About Me</h2>
        <p>
            My wife, Karli, and I have been married for a little over a year<br/>
            <small>(we celebrated our first-year anniversary the Sunday before school started!)</small><br/>
            My wife is currently studying at Paul Mitchell, here in Rexburg, to become a cosmetologist.<br/>
            I'm originally from Woodinville, WA.<br/>
            My dad is a programmer, which originally got me into programming,<br/>
            he would say that programmers are the pioneers of this generation!<br/>
            I'm very excited to be in this class and to learn about server-side programming!
