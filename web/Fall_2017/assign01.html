            <h2>A Little About Me</h2>
            <p>
                <img src="./images/karli_and_me.jpg" width="300" alt="Karli and me" />
                <br/> My name is Daniel Hansen<br/> 
                My major is the best major <em>ever</em>, 
                <strong>software engineering</strong><br/> 
                I met my wife a little over a year ago, at 
                BYU-I. Her name is Karli and her major is 
                also software engineering.<br/> 
                I'm from Redmond, WA<br/> 
                One of my <em>favorite</em> quotes was said
                by Theodore Roosevelt in 1910 which states,
                <br/>
            </p>
            <blockquote>"It is not the critic who counts; 
                not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, 
                or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. 
                The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the 
                arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; 
                who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again 
                and again, because there is no effort without error and 
                shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; 
                who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends 
                himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end 
                the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if
                he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his
                place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who 
                neither know victory nor defeat."
            </blockquote>
