                <h3>Scary Pumpkin</h3>
                <p>
                    This one was the first one that my wife and I did. 
                    It costs about $1.<br/> 
                    First, you'll need a plastic pumpkin and a box-cutter 
                    (or scissors if that's all you have).<br/> 
                    Second, cut a slit in the back of the pumpkin.<br/> 
                    Third, cut out the bottom of it.<br/> 
                    Lastly, put it over your porch light, and...<br/> 
                    Voila! You have a glowing pumpkin to greet the trick or treaters!

                <h3>Spooky Ghost</h3>
                <p>
                    This one was my personal favorite.<br/> 
                    First, you'll need as many sheets of white paper as you want ghosts, 
                    a pencil, sharpie, scissors, glue sticks, pink paper 
                    (if you want the derp ghost), and a couple sheets of black paper.<br/> 
                    Second, figure out the shape and design that you want (feel free to use ours!)<br/> 
                    Third, make a template in pencil and cut it out<br/> 
                    Fourth, trace the template on the white paper to make the 
                    other ghosts and cut them out<br/> 
                    Fifth, cut out the eyes, tongue, and whatever else you want on your ghosts<br/> 
                    Lastly, glue the other pieces on and..<br/> 
                    BOO! You have ghosts to scare anyone foolish enough to enter your domain!

                <h3>Icky Spiders</h3>
                <p>
                    This was the trickiest one.<br/> 
                    First, you'll need balloons, white yarn, lots of Elmer's Glue, and fake bugs.<br/> 
                    Second, inflate the balloon to the size that you want the 
                    spider sack to be and soak the yarn in the glue<br/> 
                    Seond, wrap the soaked yarn around the balloon until it's the desired look<br/> 
                    Third, hang it somewhere to dry<br/> 
                    Fourth, once the glue is dry, pop the balloon and remove it
                    as the yarn should've hardened enough to keep its shape<br/> 
                    Lastly, attach the bugs and...<br/> 
                    EEK! You have some spider sacks, that can either hang from the rafters 
                    or sit on the ground, to gross out anyone who approaches.
