            Here at Science Tech Univesity, our number one 
            concern is the success of our students. We know 
            how important it is to their future that they 
            do well in school and are prepared to join the 
            workforce and forge the future! Because of this, 
            we offer a variety of options to our students, 
            including one-on-one peer tutors, online 
            resources, and teachers who care.

        <p class="sub-header">Networking</p>
        <p class="content">
            One of the greatest challenges that graduates 
            face after college is getting their foot in 
            the door at a company. We offer expertly trained 
            mentors who will help them to learn how to develop 
            a resume, network, get themselves noticed, and 
            pass those interviews! We're here to help every 
            step of the way.
