        Seeing as this is my first page for this class,
        I thought I'd say a little about me!<br/>
        My name is Daniel Hansen,<br/> 
        my major is Software Engineering,<br/>
        I've been married to Karli Hansen for a little over a year<br/>
        (Our first anniversary was the day before the semester started)!
